# Bitcoin Transaction Visualization

I will make a Cinder App that visualizes bitcoin transactions in real-time. The app has several parts and it should be roughly look the same as [This website](https://dailyblockchain.github.io/).

1. Week 1: Fetch and store data from bitcoin transaction website
2. Week 2: Visualize transaction using Cinder
3. Week 3: Add dynamic to transactions so that they can link together

I like bitcoin, seeing transactions in realtime make me feel I'm rich.
